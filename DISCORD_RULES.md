## Be respectful

Be conscious of the words and phrases you choose when communicating with others.

Sexist, racist, and other exclusionary comments are *never* welcome in this community.

## Don't be disruptive

Avoid posting lots of (short) messages in rapid succession, as they may be disruptive.

Avoid posting outsized amounts of self-promotional material.

## Help us

If you see something that goes against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know via DM.
