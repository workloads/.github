# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project(s). Whether it is a bug report, a new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs / Feature Requests

We welcome you to use this repository's _Issue Tracker_ (accessible via the _Issues_ tab) to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open and recently closed issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.

Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

Where applicable, we use _Issue Templates_ to help you structure this information in an easy-to-digest way.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the `master` branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

For additional information on creating pull requests, please see [help.github.com](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Thank you!
